### Contributing on the code side
Testing and reporting bugs or issues helps the project immensely. 
If there is some feature you think we should have please request it, use the ***issues*** section [here](https://github.com/BossHobby/QUICKSILVER/issues)

Any coders wishing to join in, all PRs will be considered, you know where to post them.

### Donations
We have setup an Open Collective Organisation https://opencollective.com/quicksilver 
This gives us a well managed way to receive donations and high visibility how the money is spent,
as every transaction, be it donation or withdrawal, is logged publicly to this website.
