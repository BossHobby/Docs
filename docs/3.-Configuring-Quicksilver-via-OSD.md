### The osd menu is accessed by performing a RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT "[stick gesture](https://github.com/BossHobby/QUICKSILVER/wiki/4.-FEATURES#stick-gestures)" on the ROLL/PITCH stick.

Almost every setting from the configurator is available via the osd menu.

Use the ROLL/PITCH stick to navigate the menus, RIGHT enters a category and LEFT exits out to the previous level. 

After making changes, SAVE+EXIT 

If changes are made and osd is exited without SAVE+EXIT - changes will be temporarily applied but will not persist after battery disconnect.

Some changes will cause a reboot after saving.
