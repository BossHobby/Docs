## Flashing a Hex File

`Note it is best practise to power cycle the fc after flashing and before connecting to the configurator for setup`

Open the "quic-config" app. This will open a new browser tab with the configurator app. Click on the **FLASH** tab to go to the firmware flash page. The online version works excatly the same way.

### Whilst in the **FLASH** tab you will _**NOT**_ be using the **CONNECT** button in the top right

Connect a compatible flight controller via usb cable. To flash the QUICKSILVER firmware, the flight controller must be in DFU mode (bootloader mode); this can be done by holding the boot button while plugging in the flight controller, otherwise you can use the **RESET TO BOOTLOADER** button on the GUI.  
The **NO DFU DETECTED** warning message will disappear when the flight controller is recognized to be in DFU mode. If it is not recognized automatically, you may need to run the [ImpulseRC Driver Fixer tool](https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads)

Select the _Source_ from which you want to retrieve a hex file to flash. Selecting BossHobby/QUICKSILVER will download the firmware from github, or choose LOCAL if you have built your own hex file from the source code.

Next select the version (_Release_) to flash - make sure the hex file version is compatible with the gui version you are using by checking the release notes [here](https://github.com/BossHobby/QUICKSILVER/releases).

Finally, select a _Target_ file which matches your hardware. If you don't know which file to flash, make sure to ask [here](https://discord.gg/xZa6Pwwxvy), and get advice from someone experienced with the firmware. The naming convention for hex files is target_name.motor_type.receiver_type. Receiver types with names like frsky or redpine are onboard spi connected receivers, and serial refers to any serial receiver connected to a uart.

Select the **FLASH** button to initiate the flashing process. Progress bars will appear as the flashing process is performed and a feedback will be displayed in the upper right hand corner when complete

After flashing, proceed to the next stage of the wiki - CONFIGURING QUICKSILVER. If your flash was unsuccessful for any reason - do not stress. The stm32 microprocessors will not be damaged or bricked through the flashing process but may appear unresponsive after a failed flash. The quic-config app will generate a log file which will aid developers in solving the problem so please make a copy of this log and pass it along to a dev. Then, restart the quic-config app (also close the command window in the background), and manually initiate dfu by plugging the flight controller in with the boot button pressed, and try again.
